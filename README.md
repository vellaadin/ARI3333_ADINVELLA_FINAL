# ARI3333_ADINVELLA_FINAL

All files for the implementation of the ARI3333 assignment can be found in the 'Code' folder \\
Kindly note that since this repository is public, I have redacted the apis.env file which has the API tokens and URLS for both the Llama3.2 text generation model, and the bart-large-MNLI model being used for ethical prompt moderation.
