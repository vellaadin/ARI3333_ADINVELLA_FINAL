# ARI3333_ADINVELLA_FINAL (please read)

## Accessing the API Token Environment Variables

All files for the implementation of the ARI3333 assignment can be found in the 'Code' folder 

Kindly note that since this repository is public, I have redacted from this repository the 'apis.env' file which has the API tokens and URLS for both the Llama3.2 text generation model, and the bart-large-MNLI model being used for ethical prompt moderation. This was done for secutity reasons.

This file has **instead been uploaded to the 'Project Report' submission space**.

Hence you are kindly required to **add apis.env to the 'Code' folder**

## Running the System
After adding apis.env to the Code folder, open this folder within an IDE. Navigate to the 'app.py' file and execute it.

Any required dependencies will be checked for and installed via subprocess should they not be available on your machine. The system will then start within your browser.
